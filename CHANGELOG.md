# Resilience Self-Invocation Companion Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The rating prompt's local counter keeps one-way fingerprints of findings
  instead of their file paths, and deletes the list that earlier versions
  kept.
- `PRIVACY.md` describes the values the plugin keeps in the IDE's local
  settings.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Review/star CTA now links to this plugin's own Marketplace
  reviews page instead of the vendor's generic plugin list.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Warning icon on a call to a `@Retryable`/`@CircuitBreaker`/`@Retry`/
  `@RateLimiter`/`@Bulkhead`/`@TimeLimiter` method made from another
  method of the same declaring class -- bypasses the AOP proxy
  silently.
- 100% static PSI analysis, Java and Kotlin, no network calls, no
  telemetry. Free.
